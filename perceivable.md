I think it is really important to have transformability in our web design. It not only leads to our sites being able to be viewed by more people, but as teamtreehouse puts it, it leads to better formed and complete code. Even some things that are thought to be "accessability options" I find just make for better webdesign. For instance, being able to click on the word, not just the text box or making it easy to tab through links in a logical order.

However, I can see situation where this might not work. I have been to many website that rely on heavy Javascript or to get complicated points across. I find this a development of the web that is utalising ways to demonstrate data that just were possible before. Unfortunetly this leaves a hole of "How do people with disabilities view this info" and I really don't have an answer.

When designing website I think there are a couple of key things I will do:
- Use accessability options where ever possible to better label, format and flow my website.
- Make sure colours and texts have teh right contrasts to be viewable by everyone.
- Ensure the HTML follows a logical flow from least detail to most detail and works well for screen readers.
